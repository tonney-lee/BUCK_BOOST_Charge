@par Example Description 

This example provides a small application in which 2xUsarts are used for a circular 
communication using interrupts and USART firmware library.

First, the USARTy sends aTxBuffer to USARTy+1. The USARTy+1 receives data and
stores it into aRxBuffer[y].
Then, the received data is then compared with the sent one. 
Then, USARTy+1 sends the received message to the next USARTy+2.
At the end, the last one USART8 sends the data to the first One USART1.
It can validate the correctness of the USART1_TX sent data and USART1_RX received data.
These operations can be repeated infinitely.

You can see the received data stored in aRxBuffer[] variable using your toolchain debugger.

The 2xUsarts are configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled




@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\FT32f0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
