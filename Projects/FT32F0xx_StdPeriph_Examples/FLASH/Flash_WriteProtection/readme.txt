@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the FT32f0xx embedded FLASH.

- Enable Write protection: 
   To enable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_ENABLE"
   in main.c file.  
   To protect a set of pages, the user has to call the function FLASH_EnableWriteProtection.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be protected.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
 
- Disable Write protection:
   To disable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE"
   in main.c file.
   To disable the write protection of the FT32f0xx Flash, an erase of the Option 
   Bytes is necessary. This operation is done by the function FLASH_EraseOptionBytes.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.

If the desired pages are not write protected, an erase and a write operation are
performed.
