@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Timing 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel in order to generate
4 different time bases.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), to get TIM3 counter 
clock at 6 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 48MHz.

The TIM3 CC1 register value is equal to 40961, 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 146.48 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates an interrupt each 6.8ms

The TIM3 CC2 register is equal to 27309, 
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 219.7 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates an interrupt each 4.55ms

The TIM3 CC3 register is equal to 13654, 
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 439.4Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates an interrupt each 2.27ms

The TIM3 CC4 register is equal to 6826, 
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  878.9 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates an interrupt each 1.13ms.

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, 4 leds (LED1, LED2, 
LED3 and LED4) are toggled with the following frequencies: 

- LED1: 73.24Hz (CC1)
- LED2: 109.8Hz (CC2)
- LED3: 219.7Hz (CC3) 
- LED4: 439.4Hz (CC4)
 



         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on FT32f0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with FMD FT32F030XX-EVAL and
    FT32F072X8-EVAL

  - FT32F030XX-EVAL Set-up
    -  Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PC.10, PC.11, PC.12
      and PD.02 pins and connect them on an oscilloscope to show the different 
      Time Base signals.
  - FT32F072X8-EVAL Set-up
    -  Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.08, PD.09, PD.10
      and PD.11 pins and connect them on an oscilloscope to show the different 
      Time Base signals.
