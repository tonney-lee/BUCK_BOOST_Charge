The TIM1 clock frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).

SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz.

TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed. 
The "TIM1Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM1Freq = TIM1 counter clock / Capture in Hz,
where the Capture is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures. 

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1100 Hz.
 


  - FT32F030XX-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PA.09).
    
  - FT32F072X8-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PA.09).
