@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM3 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different frequencies.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to 48 MHz

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 40961: 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 1171.8Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 585.9Hz.

The TIM3 CCR2 register is equal to 20480:
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 2343.75Hz
so the TIM3 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1171.8Hz.

The TIM3 CCR3 register is equal to 10240:
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 4687.5Hz
so the TIM3 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 2343.75Hz.

The TIM3 CCR4 register is equal to 5120:
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  9375Hz
so the TIM3 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 4687.5Hz.
