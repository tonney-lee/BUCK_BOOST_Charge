@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 7 PWM signals 
with 4 different duty cycles (50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5%).

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz for FT32f0xx devices.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
The channel 1 and channel 1N duty cycle is set to 50%
The channel 2 and channel 2N duty cycle is set to 37.5%
The channel 3 and channel 3N duty cycle is set to 25%
The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5%
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.
