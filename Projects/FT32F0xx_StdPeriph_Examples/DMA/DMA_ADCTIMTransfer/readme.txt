@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer
continuously a data from a peripheral (ADC1) to another peripheral (TIM3) supporting
DMA transfer.The ADC channel11 for FT32F030XX-EVAL or ADC channel10 for
FT32F072X8-EVAL is configured to be converted continuously. 
TIM3_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on its output.

The dedicated DMA1 channel3 is configured to transfer in circular mode the last ADC 
channel11 converted value to the TIM3_CCR1 register. The DMA channel request is driven
by the TIM3 update event. The duty cycle of TIM3_CH1 output signal is then changed
each time the input voltage value on ADC channel is modified.

The duty cycle variation can be visualized on oscilloscope on the TIM3_CH1 pin
PA.06 while changing the analog input on ADC channel11 for FT32F030XX-EVAL
or ADC channel10 for FT32F072X8-EVAL using the potentiometer.
