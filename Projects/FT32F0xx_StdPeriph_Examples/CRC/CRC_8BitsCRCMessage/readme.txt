@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the CRC peripheral in order to compute
8-bit CRC checksum of a message.
The CRC peripheral is configured to use the 8-bit CRC polynomial X32 + X26 + X23 + X22 + X16 + X12 + X11 + 
                                              X10 +X8 + X7 + X5 + X4 + X2+ X + 1 */
with the initialization value is set to 0.
The message is declared as an array and labeled "CRCBuffer".
The expected CRC value is already computed using an on line CRC tool.
Once the CRC value is computed, the computed CRC value is compared to the expected
one. In case of match the green led LD1 is turned on. Otherwise the led LD3 is turned on.
